# Chapter Five: Manipulation and Grasping

*Interacting with the world: Hands, Grippers, and Dexterity.*

## Introduction

Locomotion gets you to the job; manipulation *does* the job. Human hands are engineering marvels. Replicating them is hard.

### End Effectors
- **Parallel Jaw Grippers:** Simple, robust, good for pick-and-place.
- **Multi-fingered Hands:** Complex, capable of in-hand manipulation (reorienting an object without letting go).

### Grasp Planning
How do you pick up a mug? By the handle? By the rim? It depends on what you want to do with it. We use pose estimation to determine the object's orientation and then plan a collision-free path for the arm.

## Key Takeaways

1.  Understanding the core concept of **Manipulation and Grasping**.
2.  Recognizing the challenges in this specific domain.
3.  Preparing for the practical application in the next chapter.
