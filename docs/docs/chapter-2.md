# Chapter Two: Anatomy of a Humanoid

*Hardware fundamentals: Actuators, Sensors, and Kinematics.*

## Introduction

A humanoid robot is an incredibly complex system of systems. To build or program one, you must understand its anatomy.

### The Skeleton and Actuators
Unlike a car, a humanoid has a high degree of freedom (DoF). A typical humanoid might have 20 to 50 actuators.
- **Series Elastic Actuators (SEA):** Often used for compliance and shock absorption.
- **Quasi-Direct Drive (QDD):** High torque density, good for dynamic motion.

### The Nervous System
Sensors are the robot's link to reality.
- **Proprioception:** Encoders in motors tell the robot where its limbs are.
- **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit):** The inner ear, crucial for balance.
- **Force/Torque Sensors:** Allowing the robot to feel interactions.

## Key Takeaways

1.  Understanding the core concept of **Anatomy of a Humanoid**.
2.  Recognizing the challenges in this specific domain.
3.  Preparing for the practical application in the next chapter.
