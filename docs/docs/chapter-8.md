# Chapter Eight: Human Robot Interaction HRI

*Safety, trust, and social intelligence.*

## Introduction

As humanoids enter our homes and factories, they must be safe and socially acceptable.

### Safety First
- **Passive Safety:** Soft materials, lightweight limbs.
- **Active Safety:** Collision detection and emergency stops.

### Social Cues
A humanoid shouldn't just stare blankly. It should use gaze to indicate attention. It should verify commands. HRI is about building a mental model of the human partner so the robot can be helpful, not annoying or scary.

## Key Takeaways

1.  Understanding the core concept of **Human Robot Interaction HRI**.
2.  Recognizing the challenges in this specific domain.
3.  Preparing for the practical application in the next chapter.
