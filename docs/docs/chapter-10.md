# Chapter Ten: Future Frontiers

*Generative AI, AGI, and what comes next.*

## Introduction

We are just getting started. The future of Humanoid Robotics is tied to the future of AGI.

### Foundation Models for Control
Just as GPT-4 understands all text, we are building "Robotic Foundation Models" trained on all robot data. A model that knows how to open a door with a Gripper A can generalize to opening a fridge with Hand B.

### The Road Ahead
We will see robots that can watch a YouTube video of a DIY repair and then perform that repair in the real world. The line between digital intelligence and physical action is blurring forever.

## Key Takeaways

1.  Understanding the core concept of **Future Frontiers**.
2.  Recognizing the challenges in this specific domain.
3.  Preparing for the practical application in the next chapter.
