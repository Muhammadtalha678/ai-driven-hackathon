## Prompt

/sp.constitution A user asked for guidance on establishing a constitution for the “Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Textbook” project. The project includes:Building a textbook site using Docusaurus and publishing it through GitHub Pages 2) Applying Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code to carry out AI-assisted, specification-driven development 3)Creating learning materials focused on humanoid robotics. The user later requested that the /sp.constitution command be executed to generate the constitution file.

## Response snapshot

Created project constitution v1.0.0 with 5 core principles covering Spec-Driven Development, Infrastructure as Code, AI-Augmented Workflow, Quality, and Continuous Delivery.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Established project governance and core principles.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan or /sp.spec for the first feature.
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution template adapted for a textbook/Docusaurus project.
