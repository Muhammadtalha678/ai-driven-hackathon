# Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid

This is the capstone project for the course. In this project, you will build a simulated autonomous humanoid that can receive a voice command, plan a path, navigate obstacles, identify an object, and manipulate it.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to build a robot that can clean a room. The robot should be able to:

- Receive a voice command, such as "Clean the room".
- Plan a path to navigate the room.
- Avoid obstacles, such as furniture.
- Identify trash, such as empty cans and bottles.
- Pick up the trash and put it in a trash can.

## Project Requirements

- You must use ROS 2 for the robot's software.
- You must use Gazebo or Unity for the robot's simulation.
- You must use NVIDIA Isaac Sim for the robot's perception.
- You must use a large language model (LLM) for the robot's cognitive planning.
- You must use OpenAI's Whisper for the robot's voice-to-action system.

## Project Guide

The project guide will be provided in a separate document.
