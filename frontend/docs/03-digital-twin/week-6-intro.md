# Digital Twin Introduction

This week, we will cover the basics of creating a digital twin of a robot.

## Physics Simulation in Gazebo

Gazebo is a powerful robot simulator that allows you to simulate a robot in a 3D environment. You can use Gazebo to test your robot's control algorithms, sensor data, and overall behavior in a safe and controlled environment.



## High-fidelity rendering in Unity



Unity is a popular game engine that can also be used for robot simulation. Unity provides high-fidelity rendering, which allows you to create realistic-looking simulations. This is particularly useful for training and testing computer vision algorithms.

## Simulating sensors

In addition to simulating the robot itself, you can also simulate its sensors. This includes:

- LiDAR
- Depth Cameras
- IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units)
