# NVIDIA Isaac Sim

This week, we will cover the basics of NVIDIA Isaac Sim.

## Isaac Sim

NVIDIA Isaac Sim is a photorealistic robotics simulator that is built on top of NVIDIA's Omniverse platform. It allows you to create stunningly realistic simulations of your robot and its environment.



## Isaac ROS



Isaac ROS is a collection of hardware-accelerated ROS 2 packages for perception, navigation, and manipulation. These packages are optimized for NVIDIA's Jetson platform, but they can also be used in simulation with Isaac Sim.

## Nav2

Nav2 is the navigation stack for ROS 2. It allows your robot to autonomously navigate from one point to another, while avoiding obstacles. Nav2 is particularly important for bipedal humanoid movement, as it can be used to generate stable walking gaits.
